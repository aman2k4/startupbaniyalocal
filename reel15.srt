00:00:00,992 --> 00:00:02,514
Hello I am here.

2
00:00:03,557 --> 00:00:04,428
Hi.

3
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:05,817
Hi! I'm Samantha.

4
00:00:05,817 --> 00:00:06,386
Imagine a

5
00:00:06,386 --> 00:00:07,159
banking app

6
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:07,747
In which

7
00:00:07,747 --> 00:00:08,242
you said

8
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:09,139
transfer ₹50

9
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:09,670
to Amit

10
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,618
As per your

11
00:00:10,618 --> 00:00:11,590
instructions, I have

12
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,804
transferred ₹50

13
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:13,990
to Amit and

14
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,984
he will do it.

15
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:15,879
Nowadays our

16
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:16,430
interaction with

17
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,476
Computer is becoming

18
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:18,037
more like

19
00:00:18,037 --> 00:00:18,672
we're talking

20
00:00:18,672 --> 00:00:20,273
to human .

21
00:00:20,273 --> 00:00:21,463
Basically to chatter.

22
00:00:21,463 --> 00:00:22,198
Let's look at

23
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,039
a little history

24
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:23,803
of UX UI.

25
00:00:23,803 --> 00:00:24,617
Come, first of

26
00:00:24,617 --> 00:00:25,670
all punchcard type

27
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,899
computers came

28
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,136
around 1970's,

29
00:00:28,136 --> 00:00:29,052
In which you

30
00:00:29,053 --> 00:00:29,979
have to insert

31
00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:30,550
the punchcard and

32
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,430
it will execute

33
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,186
the program.

34
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:32,764
Then came

35
00:00:32,764 --> 00:00:33,277
computer systems

36
00:00:33,277 --> 00:00:33,986
with command line

37
00:00:33,986 --> 00:00:34,990
interface, In which

38
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:35,843
you give commands

39
00:00:35,843 --> 00:00:36,750
in scripting language

40
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,677
to computer in

41
00:00:37,677 --> 00:00:38,412
order to interact

42
00:00:38,412 --> 00:00:39,128
with them.

43
00:00:39,128 --> 00:00:39,625
After that

44
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:40,630
came graphical

45
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,991
user interface GUI,

46
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:43,470
In which mouse

47
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,515
was invented to

48
00:00:44,515 --> 00:00:45,590
interact with them.

49
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,186
Because the mouse

50
00:00:46,186 --> 00:00:46,669
works like

51
00:00:46,669 --> 00:00:47,310
pointer.

52
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,285
Then came touch

53
00:00:48,285 --> 00:00:49,310
screen mobiles

54
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,403
phone ,which does

55
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:51,550
not require mouse

56
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,214
and keyboard

57
00:00:52,214 --> 00:00:52,695
external hardware.

58
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:53,190
The work

59
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,320
is done only

60
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,016
with touch screen.

61
00:00:55,016 --> 00:00:55,630
Now today

62
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,396
chaat pods are

63
00:00:56,396 --> 00:00:56,990
used everywhere ,

64
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,950
like Chatgpt

65
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,509
These computer

66
00:00:58,509 --> 00:00:59,470
systems have

67
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,296
become as if

68
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:01,113
you are now

69
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:01,830
talking to

70
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,696
another human being.

71
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:03,410
It's fun now,

72
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,001
isn't it?

73
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:04,815
So humanity is

74
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:05,463
now moving forward

75
00:01:05,463 --> 00:01:06,030
like this.

76
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,810
Think how you

77
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,336
can make a

78
00:01:07,336 --> 00:01:07,713
product in

79
00:01:07,713 --> 00:01:07,982
this direction
